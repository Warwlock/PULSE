# PULSE - Post-Processing Utilities, LUTs, and Special Effects

Pulse is a comprehensive post-processing pipeline designed to enhance the visual quality of rendered images. It offers a wide range of customizable effects and filters to apply to the final rendered frames. Pulse enables developers to add depth of field, motion blur, color grading, tone mapping, and many other post-processing effects to achieve the desired aesthetic for their projects. Also you can create you custom post-processing effects with shaders (Probably it will be the Unity's Full Screen Renderer Feature).

* Newly made effects (`Will Be Added` tagged ones) will be added to this repository soon. I can't promise it will be regular and organised.
* Yes, Unity has some of the Post Processing effetcs. But those are Renderer Feature based effects.
* References for scripts and documentation will be added.
